# Problems of Implementations

* A main function is consisted of many basic blocks. Wrongfully the implementation thus far combines all the aforementioned "main" function as a basic block without cutting at jumps or calls

# Things to talk about
* Description of algorithms
* Difference of algorithms

# Metrics
* Metrics for everything, search, opening, incrementing..
